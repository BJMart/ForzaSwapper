Giving engines real names: As it says you can give engines modern names in a click this is done by downloading the project forza plus 4 engine spreadsheet and importing the names used in there.

Add all Tyre compounds to any car: in 1 click you can add street tyres and vintage tyres to any sort of car that wouldn't normally have them 

Exporting engines to other forza games: Ever wished that you could drive a car from an older forza game in a newer one well we can't quite do that but you can bring the engine over, currently engine sounds are not carried over and will need to be manually added 

Power graphing: If you ever wanted to see how much power your engine makes before you open forza this tool can calculate the power that will be created by modded upgrades

Engine Duplication/Deleting: If you really want to mod an engine such as changing torque curves or even sound and don't want to risk messing up the original engine you can duplicate an engine for these purposes and if you decide you don't want it anymore you can delete it

Upcoming:
Upgrade modification: changing the power each part makes or other stats about them
Drivetrain Editing: Make any car be able to have FWD and change the gear ratios
Specific Forza support: be able to detect the forza game you're trying to modify and make optimizations for them
